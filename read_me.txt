So this is a fully automated facebook scraper that scrapes the posts of an account and gives out information from that account like the post description,
post link or image link, the description of the image (img src: what is present inside the image or more precisely what the image is about)
In addition to that this program also automates the login or sign up process, it also filters the posts on the basis of years, months and days.
After the program is done executing, the output will be in the form of a list. I have also provided the code of converting this list into an excel in your local file.
NOTE: Facebook keeps on changing and updating, I have no guarentee that the fields provided in this code will be the same 6 months after this file is uploaded.
      So you have to find out the src,classes,div on your own.
